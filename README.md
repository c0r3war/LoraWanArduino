# LoraWan Arduino tests on Heltec LORA 32

## Setup of VSCode

1) Install Arduino IDE
2) Install VSCode
3) Install Arduino extension from Microsoft
4) In Arduino IDE, install Heltec Lora 32 extension: https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp32/quick_start.html

## Setup project

1) Create a new workspace.
2) Create a folder for the project. Folder must contain subb directory named 'build' (this one will be used for Arduino build, it will speed up subsequent compilations). Add the project folder to workspace. 
3) Setup Git repo (don't forget to create a .gitignore to exclude the build folder, .vscode folder, etc).
4) Setup the Heltec Lora 32 board (shift+cmd+P, Arduino:Board Config), and the serial port to use (shif+cmd+P, Arduino:Select Serial Port).
5) Setup libraries (shift+cmd+P, Arduino: Library Manager): you will need MCCI LoraWan LMIC Libray (https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic) and U8g2 for screen (https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2).
6) Configure project settings in arduino.json:
    * "output": "build" (will save you time during build)
7) Don't forget to setup LMIC library. You have to tell the library the radio region AND the Lora chip of your board (Semtech sx1276 for the Heltec board). This can be done either through compiler options (but looks like it's pretty complicated/not recommended with Arduino IDE), or by editing *project_config/lmic_project_config.h* file, more informations in the [README.MD](https://github.com/mcci-catena/arduino-lmic#adding-regions) of the MCCI LMIC lib.  
Unfortunatelly, in Arduino environment, the lmic_project_config.h is shared among all projetcts (so your settings will have to be the same, this should not be an issue for simple projects). You will find the file in the Arduino libraries folder, in *MCCI_LoRaWAN_LMIC_library/project_config/*.

## First stage: create an application
![application creation](/images/appcreation.png)

## First test: ABP enrolment mode

In ABP mode, the AppSKey (the key for payload encryption) and the NwkSKey (the key for message integrity check) are statically generated and included in the device's code. 

**This is considered insecure, but it is handfull for tests**

### Step 1: Device registration
Device must be registered though TTN portal. Device is attached to th application that has been previously created.

By default, the Activation Method is set to OTAA. For the test, it must be changed to ABP in the dvice's settings.

Once validated, NwSKey and AppSKey are generated by the portal:
